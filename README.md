# 2017 U.S. County Data Correlations
This project was intended to look at biases in the United States. After examining various demographic and economic statistics for each county within the United States from 2017, it is clear that certain relationships amongst these variables are significant. The trends in the data are shown through both choropleth maps and an examination of correlation coefficients with their statistical significance. In the dashboard created for this project, a visitor can choose to examine one demographic and one economic factor of their choosing. Through our analysis, we identified some of the strongest relationships between demographic and economic factors occur between % Black to Poverty Rate, % White to % Self-Employed, and % Asian to Average Income.
